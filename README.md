# Road-Accidents-Analysis

Overview
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to provide insights into road accident trends and patterns. Utilizing Power BI, this dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed analyses that help stakeholders understand the factors contributing to road accidents. This README file outlines the dashboard's features, data sources, and usage instructions.

Dashboard Features
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
CY Accidents: Displays the total number of road accidents for the current year (CY).
YoY Accidents: Shows the year-over-year (YoY) comparison of road accidents, highlighting trends and changes over time.

Detailed Analyses
Data by Location: Provides a geographic analysis of accidents, identifying high-risk areas and accident hotspots.
Accidents by Vehicle Type: Analyzes accidents based on the types of vehicles involved, including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles.
Light Conditions: Examines the impact of light conditions (daylight, dusk, night) on the frequency and severity of accidents.
Weather Conditions: Investigates how different weather conditions (rain, fog, snow, clear) correlate with accident rates.

Usage Instructions
Accessing the Dashboard: Open the Power BI application or access the dashboard via the Power BI web service.
Navigating the Dashboard: Use the interactive elements such as slicers, filters, and drill-throughs to explore different aspects of the data.
Analyzing KPIs: View the KPIs to get a snapshot of the current year’s accident statistics and year-over-year trends.
Exploring Detailed Analyses: Use the various visualizations to delve deeper into the specifics of accidents by type, location, vehicle type, light conditions, and weather conditions.
Generating Reports: Export visualizations and data for reporting and further analysis.

Interpretation and Insights
Identify High-Risk Areas: Utilize the location analysis to pinpoint regions with high accident rates and focus safety measures accordingly.
Understand Contributing Factors: Analyze the impact of vehicle types, light, and weather conditions to develop targeted interventions for reducing accidents.
Monitor Trends: Keep track of yearly trends in road accidents to evaluate the effectiveness of safety initiatives and policies.
